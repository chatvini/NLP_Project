3,Decent product,Loved the ColorGood FinishIt's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned.Display is very dullAlmost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thingCam is great for this price pointSpot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization..90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.READ MORE
5,Wonderful,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11.

5,Just wow!,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N...READ MORE"
4,Wonderful,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display.The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag.The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight.I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ...READ MORE"
4,Very Good,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user.Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful.90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother.Battery lasts long enough to not bother you.And moto unique features are like cherry on the top.You can go for it without even thinking twice.READ MORE

5,Best smartphone for productivity.,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone.

5,Classy product,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span.READ MORE"

2,Not good,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot.Camera:Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.Display:If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...READ MORE

2,Very Disappointed with this phone,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...READ MORE
5,Terrific purchase,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy.READ MORE"

3,Fair,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for  spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless.

Previously I was using MotoG5s+ which had almost a complete day battery power even after 3 yrs of use, but this device hardly survive for 12hrs.2. Slow charging.

4,Very Good,"After using this phone for 4 days, I experience the following things-Battery- It lasts for 1day (24 hrs) in medium use (browsing, YouTube, prime video, jio tv etc.). It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge from 0% to 100% with its 20W charger. I think Moto should have provided more powerful charger. Heating is not an issue.
